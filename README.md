# 🚀 Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application with Streamlit, ChromaDB, and OpenAI - Part I 🌟

## 🧐 Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines **document retrieval** with **language generation** to deliver answers that are grounded in retrieved content. This approach is powerful for applications that need answers based on **large document collections**—think **document search engines**, **legal document analysis**, and **customer support tools**.

In this project, we’ll build a RAG application using **Streamlit** for the user interface, **ChromaDB** for document retrieval, and **OpenAI’s GPT model** for response generation. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️

## 🎯 What We'll Build
Our application will let users:
- 📄 Upload PDF documents for ingestion
- 💬 Ask specific questions about the documents
- 🔍 Retrieve relevant information and generate context-based answers using OpenAI's language model

This setup is perfect for handling large, complex documents and can be tailored to various use cases. 🌐

## 📋 Prerequisites
To get started, make sure you have:
- Python 3.12+
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for building the user interface
- [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com) for managing and querying document embeddings
- An OpenAI API Key for GPT-powered responses
